# What is a State?
The state is a built-in React object/feature that allows you to store and manage dynamic data used to contain data or information about the component.

# What is the difference between state and props?
Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, while state is used to manage data within a component. 
Props are immutable and cannot be changed within a component, while state is mutable and can be updated using the setState function.
